## Summary
How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact and are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?
- There are 72,458 positions that need to be filled as the 'silver tsunami' begins to make an impact and when using the year 1965 as the mentor-eligible date, we find out that there are not mentors to mentor the new employees that are soon to be coming through the doors. 

An additional query that can help in the analysis is expanding the mentor eligibility. Allowing other longer tenured memebers of the company to mentor the new employees could ease the transition into the new phase of the company.
